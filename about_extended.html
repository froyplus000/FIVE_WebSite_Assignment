		Born in Vietnam, a developing country, and has lived in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, for 17 years. With a population of approximately 8.4 million people.

After 17 years of being born and raised in this small country, I temporarily bid farewell to my parents and embarked on a new journey in Australia with the hope that my life and myself would change.
